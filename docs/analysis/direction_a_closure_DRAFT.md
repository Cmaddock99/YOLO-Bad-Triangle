# Direction A Closure Document (DRAFT)
**Status:** INCOMPLETE — 500-image validation complete; awaiting Round 4 result or explicit verdict
**Date started:** 2026-04-09
**Complete when:** Round 4 result lands OR decision made to defer/retire

---

## Project Goal

YOLO-Bad-Triangle runs the attack-defend-fortify triad on a YOLO object detection model:

1. **Attack** — find and characterize adversarial perturbations that degrade detection
2. **Defend** — apply preprocessing or learned defenses to recover performance
3. **Fortify** — improve the defended stack based on measured results, iteratively

---

## Direction A Question

Is c_dog (DPC-UNet neural defense) worth continuing as a fortification path, relative
to classical defenses, on the worst validated attacks?

---

## Authoritative Evidence (Phase 4 only, verified from cycle_history/)

Recovery = defended mAP50 − undefended mAP50 for that attack.
Checkpoint round determined by file modification timestamp (Round 3 deployed 2026-04-04 18:29).

### Anomaly notes

- c11 and c12 both used Round 2 checkpoint but show different c_dog results on deepfool
  (0.2403 vs 0.2065). deepfool has no fixed seed — measurement variance is the likely cause.
- c13–c15 Phase 4 results are identical. Confirmed fresh (timestamps verified). Deterministic
  pipeline with same Round 3 checkpoint, same attack params, same 500-image COCO subset.
- run_summary.json missing from c12–c15 validate_deepfool_c_dog artifacts. Root cause:
  pre-atomic-write code (fixed in commit acbb1a5, 2026-04-08). Historical; not backfilled.
- ts7525 sweep run failed on first attempt with TypeError (duplicate `passes` kwarg:
  `passes=passes_meta` explicit + `**stats` containing `passes` from multipass wrapper).
  Fixed: removed explicit kwarg, injected `stats["passes"]=1` for single-pass path.
  Single-pass ts10/ts25 results unaffected. Fix applied in commits a9e5334 (Mac) / fca5603 (NUC).
- 100-image ts7525 diagnostic (0.2929) did not hold at 500 images (0.2600). Delta of 0.033
  exceeds ±0.005 noise floor — the 100-image sample over-estimated improvement. Gate decisions
  should always use 500-image results as authoritative.

## Fortification Actions Tried

| Round | Target | Method | Deepfool result | Square result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | deepfool + blur | Colab finetune from scratch | modest improvement | not measured |
| Round 2 | deepfool + blur | Colab continued from R1 | similar to R1 | not measured |
| Round 3 | deepfool + blur + square | multi-attack mix, Colab from R2 | no measurable improvement | regressed vs R2 |
| Timestep sweep | deepfool | param tuning (ts10/ts25/ts7525) | ts7525 best: 0.2929 (+0.0745); single-pass variants flat at ~0.268 | not applicable |
| 500-img ts7525 validation | deepfool | full-scale confirm of ts7525 result | 0.2600 (+0.0362 vs R3 c_dog) | not applicable |
| Round 4 | deepfool-only, ts7525 schedule | deepfool-focused Colab retrain from R3 checkpoint | [TBD — pending YOLOv26 timing decision] | [TBD] |

**Pattern:** Multi-attack mixing (Round 3) caused regression on both targets. Single-attack
focus is required going forward.

## Key Structural Findings

1. **deepfool vs c_dog — gap reduced but not closed:** Single-pass c_dog (ts25) reaches
   0.2238–0.2679, leaving a 0.0937–0.0496 gap to jpeg. Multi-pass ts7525 reaches 0.2929
   (gap to jpeg: 0.0246) — the coarse→fine schedule partially handles high-frequency
   perturbations. This disproves a pure "architectural ceiling" claim: scheduling is the
   variable. However, c_dog ts7525 remains third on deepfool behind median (0.3656) and
   jpeg (0.3175) on 100-image diagnostic runs. 500-image validation determines whether
   0.2929 holds at full scale before any verdict is written.

2. **square is better matched:** Large-patch occlusion (square attack) is well-suited
   to diffusion denoising's inpainting-style recovery. jpeg HURTS on square (-0.0383).
   Round 2 c_dog was the only defense with meaningful positive recovery (+0.0260).

3. **Round 3 regressed both:** Multi-attack training diluted gradient signal.
   c_dog with Round 3 is worse than Round 2 on both attacks.
